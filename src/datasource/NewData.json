However, resistance from conservative officials and lack of structural reforms limited its success. Unlike Japan’s Meiji Restoration, China’s reforms were slow, leading to continued foreign dominance and internal instability."

                            "content": "Nationalist movements emerged in both China and Japan. In China, Sun Yat-sen’s ideas of democracy, nationalism, and socialism inspired the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911. In Japan, nationalism was state-sponsored, emphasizing loyalty to the emperor and military expansion. This shaped both nations’ responses to modernization."

Japan introduced universal education with Western subjects like science and technology. China, though slower, established schools teaching Western knowledge alongside Confucian principles. Overseas students played a key role in bringing back modern ideas and innovations."

China, however, relied on foreign investments and struggled with internal conflicts. Japan’s Zaibatsu (industrial conglomerates) became economic powerhouses, while China’s economy remained fragmented due to warlordism and Western exploitation."

China’s military reforms failed due to corruption and lack of discipline. The contrast between Japan’s rise and China’s decline highlighted the importance of military modernization in national survival."

Japan saw the decline of the samurai class and the rise of industrial workers, while China faced peasant uprisings and revolutionary movements. Traditional roles of women changed, with increasing opportunities in education and employment. However, modernization also led to imperial ambitions, particularly in Japan."
