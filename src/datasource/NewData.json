It is divided into three phases: Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age). These phases represent human progress in tool-making, hunting, and early settlements."

They used crude stone tools for hunting and cutting. Fire was discovered during this period, which provided warmth, protection, and a way to cook food."

They trained apprentices, maintained quality, and controlled prices. Guilds held a monopoly over certain products, making it hard for new traders to start businesses.
